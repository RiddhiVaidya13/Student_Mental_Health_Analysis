This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project titled "Student Mental Health Analysis", focused on understanding how various academic, lifestyle, and behavioral factors influence stress levels among students.

📌 Project Overview:
Objective: To analyze the impact of online learning and associated lifestyle changes on student mental health, especially stress levels.

Data Source: [Mention if public, or “Confidential” if private]

Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), MS PowerPoint

Key Variables: Screen time, sleep duration, physical activity, exam anxiety, education level, and age.

Major Insights:

Students aged 20–22 show higher stress, likely due to career and academic pressure.

Higher screen time is correlated with increased stress.

Longer sleep duration correlates with lower stress.

Exam anxiety is a strong indicator of high stress levels.

Surprisingly, high stress students also report more physical activity, possibly as a coping mechanism.
